#Welcome to the AI Camp Creative Coders team!

This repo documents all the work from a one week training camp led at AI Camp. The focus of the camp was on conducting EDA on a dataset of used car resales. The students were taught through the mini project in the EDA_mini_project.ipynb file and were able to apply their knowledge to their individual work, which can be found in the individual-work folder. The final EDA was completed by combining the individual work in the Final_EDA.ipynb file.

To keep track of our progress, we used the live Project_Plan.md file. The used car dataset we worked with can be found in the car_data.csv file, and the intro_to_python.ipynb file contains the Python teaching material provided to the students.

At the end of the training camp, the students built a streamlit webapp, the code for which can be found in the main.py file. The requirements for the webapp can be found in the requirements.txt file. The webapp can be accessed at the following link: https://harishasan001-ai-camp-webapp-main-swpydr.streamlit.app/.

Thank you for visiting the repo and we hope you find the resources and work helpful!
